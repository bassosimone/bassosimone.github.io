        <p>The Neubot project is based on an open-source computer program, the Neubot, that, downloaded
        and installed by Internet users, performs quality of service measurements and collects data at
        a central server. The raw results are published on the web under the terms and conditions of
        the Creative Commons Zero license. This paper is the guide for researchers and individuals that
        aims to study, build on and analyze Neubot methodology and results. We provide an exhaustive
        documentation of Neubotâ€™s HTTP test behavior, along with a discussion of the methodology. Besides
        that, the article shows an analysis of the Turin-area results (in the May-September time
        interval) and explains the rationale behind the privacy policy, which allows us to publish
        results as raw data.</p>

        <p>The "Network Neutrality Bot" (Neubot) is a software application that measures, in a distributed way,
        Internet access quality of service with a specific emphasis on detection of potential network neutrality
        violations (such as peer-to-peer traffic discrimination). It is based on a light- weight, open-source
        computer program that can be downloaded and installed by ordinary Internet users. The program performs
        background tests: the results are sent to a centralized server (or collection of servers), which publishes
        them, thus rebalancing, at least in part, the current deep information asymmetry between Internet Service
        Providers and users. The collected data will allow constant monitoring of the state of the Internet,
        enabling a deeper understanding of such crucial infrastructure, as well as a more reliable basis for
        discussing network neutrality policies.</p>
